        <p id="first-paragraph">
        Established in Montebello, Segundo Books and Coffee is a space for students of all ages to do school work, research new topics, beginning projects, or reading in a cozy atmosphere. 
        With Segundo having three floors, students are able to socialize and have a cup of coffee on the first floor. 
        At the coffee shop, we serve breakfast, brunch, pastries, and of course, coffee! On the main floor we sell used books and Segundo merchandise. The second floor is dedicated to studying or reading. The second floor offers multiple study rooms, conference rooms, and a computer lab ready to be reserved for class projects, club meetings, or zoom calls. The floor contains multiple printers and IT students for any tech assistance. Lastly, the third floor is the quiet zone for students who prefer a quiet environment. We designed the building with the intention of helping students concentrate on their studies and encourage them to continue their education. Segundo was inspired by students from Montebello who noticed the importance of study spaces and accessibility for many students of the area.

        <h2 id="title">Using Abandoned Space</h2>

        <p id= "second-paragraph">
        The land where Segundo Books and Coffee will be built on used to be Montebello's "La Tourette's
        Gallery" that has been permanently closed for years. It has been up for lease for the past couple
        of years and a community of students from Montebello had thought it would be the best spot for our
        new space for students of all ages. It is located on Whittier Boulevard where people can walk to 
        Segundo or commute via one of the Montebello Buslines. Segundo is located across the street from 
        Montebello Bus Line 10: Whittwood Mall, which stops by Whittier, East LA college, Whittwood Mall,
        and more! With Segundo being walking distance to stores, restaurants, and the schools (Montebello 
        High School, Montebello Intermediate, and Washington Elementary) it will provide great resources 
        and experiences for Montebello Youth.

        <h2 id="title">Opportunities for Montebello Youth</h2>
        <p id= "third-paragraph">
        Montebello High Schoolers and college students have the opporunity to volunteer or work at Segundo!
        Training will be a must and we focus on the youth's strengths. Here at Segundo, we want people of 
        Montebello to strengthen the skills they are best at and not be afraid to learn something new! We
        hold various events every month where everyone is welcome to attend and participate.

        <h2 id="title"> Resilience Criteria</h2>
       
        <p id= "fourth-paragraph"> 
        Segundo Books and Coffee averages a 4 out of 5 energy score (system 3) in the Resilience 
        Criteria assessment. Our energy supply is stable and consistent as we have a solar panneled rooftop to 
        the building. Our Energy comes from local renewable resources, and we find it important to conserve as much as 
        possible, using less lighting throughout the day and use natural sunlight. During closing hours, our building 
        will be completely turned off. For when we need to use lights, we will be utilizing power-saving lightbulbs. 
        We are also proud to say we are self-reliant, and that our community can supply and share energy in case of an
        emergency.
        </p>

        <p id= "fifth-paragraph">
        Segundo also averages 3 out of 5 Jobs and Economy score (system 5) in the Resilience Criteria.
        The resources that Segundo provides can contribute to community's well-being, such as offering 
        training programs (college application program, volunteer services, etc.). We provide safe working 
        conditions, fair business practices, and environmental stewardship. We ensure our workers of their 
        worker's rights, including minors that may be working seasonal shifts. Because the majority of Segundo 
        is self-reliant and many items are produced locally, Segundo provides sustainability in Montebello.
        For instance, we use Montebello's Promotional Graphics, Inc. for promotional items such as banners.
